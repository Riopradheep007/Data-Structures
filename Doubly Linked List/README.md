Advantages:

   * Reversing the doubly linked list is very easy.
    
   * It can allocate or reallocate memory easily during its execution.
    
   * As with a singly linked list, it is the easiest data structure to implement.
    
   * The traversal of this doubly linked list is bidirectional which is not possible in a singly linked list.
    
   *  Deletion of nodes is easy as compared to a Singly Linked List. A singly linked list deletion requires a pointer to the node and previous node to be deleted but in the doubly linked list, it only required the pointer which is to be deleted.


Applications:


    - A music player which has next and prev buttons.
    
    - Represent a deck of cards in a game.
    
    - The browser cache which allows you to hit the BACK-FORWARD pages.
    
    - Applications that have a Most Recently Used list (a linked list of file names)
    
    - Undo-Redo functionality
