Advantages:

Reversing the doubly linked list is very easy.
It can allocate or reallocate memory easily during its execution.
As with a singly linked list, it is the easiest data structure to implement.
The traversal of this doubly linked list is bidirectional which is not possible in a singly linked list.
Deletion of nodes is easy as compared to a Singly Linked List. A singly linked list deletion requires a pointer to the node and previous node to be deleted but in the doubly linked list, it only required the pointer which is to be deleted.
